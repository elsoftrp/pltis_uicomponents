The job was splitted into phases that you can see below.

The "[break] tag" means that it will break compatibility with code that uses the current TSOGrid - a refactory/replace should be done on these projects.

Log 1: refactoring, naming, structure, design, etc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- mormot2 package type has changed to Runtime instead of Runtime Only, to be able to install pltis_sogrid package on IDE
- copied pltis_sogrid to new /tranquilit dir, which will be used for all UI (and more) components (refactored) in the future
- the /source was changed to /src because naming convention
- .lpk was moved to new /pack 
- included new Tranquil Copyright header in all files 
- removed unnecessary blank lines among classes and methods
- renamed TSOGrid to TTisGrid
- renamed and/or removed *SO* prefix on types, following mORMot naming convention
- renamed all units related to tis.ui.grid.*.pas
- renamed names in .lrc, .rc files
- deleted /resources and /resources2 because its content were not used 
- created tis.ui.components.lpk, setup and compiled... everything compiled and working
- deleted tis.ui.grid.common.pas (old sogridcommon) because its content wasn't used (except TSODataEvent type, witch was migrated to tis.ui.grid.core)
- deleted tis.uid.grid.source.pas (old sogridsource) because its content wasn't used
- beautified and cleaned all units: indentation; attributes, arguments and event types naming convention; some comments; PascalCase, lowercase; etc, for almost all tokens
- moved TTisGridComponentEditor to tis.ui.grid.editor
- [break] renamed OnSOCompareNodes evento to OnCompareColumnsNodes
- added {$i mormot.defines.inc} in all units
- fixed AV in CreateColumnsFromData(): testing if Data <> nil before use it
- some minor changes and cleaning in some conditionals among methods
- a minor change in the main README.md as now package(s) will be more generic
- introducing basic /ui/README.md 
- added a clean.bat to delete all files that can be ignored
- added some TODO's along the code as "msantos"
- created a Demo for testing these two grids together in one form 

Log 2: replacing all SuperObject stuff to mORMot, and more
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- introducing /core directory
- introducing basic /core/README.md
- introducing /core/tis.core.os.pas (old soclipbrd) for clipboard stuff and more (in the future) 
- removed global JsonClipboardFormat variable
- introducing TClipboardTypes and TClipboardAdapter, for working with predefined (LCL) and extended formats (eg. JSON)
- removed clipbrd.pas dependency from tis.ui.grid.editor.pas, using just TClipboardAdapter
- [break] renamed GetNodeSOData to GetNodeDataAsDocVariant, which returns a PDocVariantData
- removed TSOItemData/PSOItemData and FItemDataOffset
- changed DoInitNode/DoFreeNode for not working with interface instances anymore
- changed DoNewText/DoGetText/DoInitNode for working with DocVariantData
- introduced "code separators" blocks as new fiels, new events, new methods, new properties, inherited methods, inherited properties; organized the code inside these blocks
- [break] changed TOnGridGetText, TOnGridPaste, TOnGridCompareColumnsNodes for using PDocVariantData
- [break] changed CheckedRows interface it's now returns TDocVariantData
- [break] changed SetFocusedRowNoClearSelection interface
- [break] changed GetCellData/GetCellStrValue interface
- [break] renamed GetCellStrValue to GetCellDataAsString
- [break] changed AddRows/PasteRows, DeleteRows interfaces for work using PDocVariantData
- [break] renamed InvalidateFordata to InvalidateNodeByDocVariant for work using PDocVariantData
- [break] changed SelectedRows/FocusedRow/Settings properties types to work using PDocVariantData 
- changed CreateColumnsFromData to work using PDocVariantData 
- introduced ClearAll method
- grid editor: added Remove All Columns button
- grid editor: added Clear All button
- grid editor: introduced Keep Data option: check this option to use the data in the target grid
- introduced ZebraColor property, replacing $00EDF0F1 hard coded constant
- fixed "List index (-1) out of bounds", when right-clicked in columns and there are none
- [break] renamed NodesForData to GetNodesBy (overload)
- [break] renamed NodesForKey to GetNodesBy (overload)
- [break] renamed NodesForKeyStr to GetNodesBy (overload)
- added more documentation
- improved PasteRows: now it's working not only for arrays but also object
- TClipboardAdapter: introduced Open, Clear, Add, and Close
- rewrite DoCopyToClipBoard, DoCopyCellToClipBoard using TClipboardAdapter and DocVariantData.Reduce
- removed pltis_superobject dependency
- validating user input on DoNewText: it will test if it's numeric or string

Demo
- udpated UI
- output options: clear, from clipboard, grid data
 
BONUS (only component names were changed, nothing more else)
- added TTisSearchEdit from TWaptSearchEdit
- added TTisToggleButton from TWaptToggleButton
- added TTisTagEditor from TTagEditor â€” however something is wrong with this component by default: if I drop one in a form I got an exception and IDE freezes - I will search what's going on latter
